### Description of dataset
  The "Coffee Quality with Locations of Origin" data set provides a comprehensive overview of Arabica and Robusta coffee samples from around the world. The data set contains 1,318 rows and 28 columns, and each row represents a unique coffee sample that has been graded and evaluated and graded by expert coffee tasters. The data set was compiled by the Coffee Quality Institute and includes both coffees' sensory evaluation values and metadata about the coffeeâ€™s origin.
  The columns in the data include detailed sensory scores such as Aroma, Flavor, Aftertaste, Acidity, Body, Balance, Uniformity, Sweetness, all scored as numerical values ranging from 0 to 10 scale. The data set also includes categorical and text fields like Country of Origin, Continent of Origin, Variety, and Processing Method, which provide descriptive information about where and in what way the coffee was grown and processed. 
  Overall, the dataset is a rich source for exploring patterns in coffee quality, regional variability in coffee characteristics, and factors behind high-scoring coffee, making it valuable for data analysts and coffee enthusiasts alike.

### Questions generated
1) How does the average coffee quality vary across countries of origin for Arabica coffee, and how trade strategies are formed due to geographic patterns?
