# Description of dataset
The "Coffee Quality with Locations of Origin" dataset, available on Kaggle, provides a comprehensive overview of Arabica coffee samples from around the world. It contains 1,318 rows and 28 columns, where each row represents a unique coffee sample that has been evaluated and graded by professional cuppers (coffee tasters). The dataset was compiled by the Coffee Quality Institute and includes both sensory evaluation scores and metadata about the coffee’s origin and characteristics.

The columns in the dataset include detailed sensory scores such as Aroma, Flavor, Aftertaste, Acidity, Body, Balance, Uniformity, Sweetness, Clean Cup, Cupper Points, and the overall Total Cup Points, all typically recorded as numeric (float) values on a 0–10 scale. In addition, it includes categorical and text fields like Country of Origin, Region, Producer, Variety, and Processing Method, which provide contextual information about where and how the coffee was grown and processed. There are also columns indicating the Harvest Year, Altitude, and Moisture Content, which are particularly useful for understanding environmental and agricultural factors that influence coffee quality.

Some fields, such as Altitude, may contain ranges or non-numeric values and may require preprocessing for analysis. Overall, the dataset is a rich source for exploring patterns in coffee quality, regional differences in coffee characteristics, and factors that contribute to high-scoring coffee, making it valuable for data analysts, coffee professionals, and enthusiasts alike.
